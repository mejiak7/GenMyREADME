# GenMyREADME

# Description
For Challenge- 9 I was asked to create a command-line application that can generate a proffesional README.md file from a user's input.

With this command-line application you can quickly and easily create a high quality README for your project.

When you first run this application it prompts the enduser with multiple questions about their project

After the enduser inputs their desired information the application then create a well structured, high quality, professional README.md which includes:
